				<h3>What is WebDuino?</h3>
				<p>The Arduino is a staple in the Maker Community, a simple, easy to use project board with a broad community following. For many people, their experience with Arduino is often their first time programming, and while they are able to connect their board to a couple sensors, the real clarity to data comes when you store it and look at it in relation to time! However, to save a substantial amount of data over time on an Arduino locally, you need to buy a shield with an SD Card slot, and wheres the fun in that?</p>

				<p>Webduino is the easiest way to quickly get your Arduino connected to the internet. All you need is a couple sensors and an internet shield!</p>

				<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
				<p>Setup is easy, once you've created an account you can configure how many sensors you have and where they will go, WebDuino will then generate code on-the-fly based on your project, code that is then pasted directly into your Arduino Sketch. Your Arduino board then sends the sensor data to WebDuino via HTTP and it is read, stored, and potentially reacted to at any time within the web interface.</p>

				<h3>How Can It Help Me?</h3>
				<p>WebDuino frees you from having to set up your own web server to record data from your arduino, giving more freedom to hobby and weekend projects.</p>
